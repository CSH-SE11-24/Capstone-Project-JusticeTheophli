Read me questions:

#1:My website is aboout my real estate bsuiness in Ghana which is targeted to young African diasporians who have in their mid 20s who want to come back to Ghana to learn about its culture, hertiage and history. I provide housing options and also fun facts about Ghana. 

#2 The features I am most proud of is the parrelex I added in the front page and also the dark mode I added on the gallery page. 

#3 If I had more time I would add more pages or style my pages better. 

#4 The accesbility feature I added was making the "Fats about Ghana" texts bigger when the user hovvered over the text with their mouse for people who can't really see small words that well. 

#5 I tried to make my project more interactive.
